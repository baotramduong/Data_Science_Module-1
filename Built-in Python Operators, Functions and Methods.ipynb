    "# Built-in Python Operators, Functions and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Data Scientist, you will spend a lot of time writing code in Python. In this lesson, we're going to introduce some features built right into the language that will allow you to perform common tasks more quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Use built-in Python functions and methods\n",
    "* Describe the difference between a function and a method\n",
    "* Use comparison operators to compare objects\n",
    "* Use logical operators to incorporate multiple conditions\n",
    "* Use identity operators to confirm the identity of an object\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing \"Objects\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the course we're going to spend a good amount of time introducing and giving you hands on practice with \"Object Oriented Programming\" (OOP). But for now, to understand how some of the features in Python work, we're going to have to provide you with a brief introduction to some basic concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a piece of reusable code. If you often want to capitalize a word, you might write (or use, if someone else has written) a \"function\" called `capitalize()` that will take a string and make it all upper case.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is a collection of data and functions. It turns out that for many types of programming, putting your functions and data together into \"objects\" is a really useful way to organize all of your code to make it easy to keep track of.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function is associated to a specific object we call it a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a number of built-in functions and various objects in Python have built-in methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Really understanding objects, functions, and methods will probably take a while, and it's something we'll come back to a number of times, but for now, here are the three things you need to know:\n",
    "* Python comes with a range of built-in pieces of code to perform common tasks\n",
    "* Some of them you use by writing their name first - e.g. `type(\"hello\")` - those are called functions\n",
    "* Others require you to take an object and \"call a method on the object\" e.g. `my_name.capitalize()` - they are methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if it's a bit confusing for now, we'll come back to this repeatedly until it's second nature!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Most higher-level languages like Python have types like strings or lists that actually come built-in with some really great functionality, which we call methods. Methods are, essentially, functions that are attached or **bound to an object**. Now that sentence might not make complete sense, so, let's unpack it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen some methods and functions already. For example, we have seen and used the `type()` function and the `.title()` method. The key difference is that the `.title()` method has always been bound to a string. The `type()` function, however, can be used on a string or any other data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"hello, i am a string.\".title() # \"Hello, I Am A String.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "type(\"hello, i am a string.\") # str\n",
    "```\n",
    "To illustrate even more clearly, try running the next cell. We will find that Python doesn't know what `title()` is when it is not attached to a string. This is because it is a **method** that is **bound** to the string. "

    "## Python Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Comparison Operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators (or Relational operators) take two elements and compare their values and then return a value that is either True or False. In Python, comparison operators are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "== # tests equality between two elements\n",
    "!= # tests inequality between two elements\n",
    "<, >, <=, >= # each tests the value between two elements\n",
    "```\n",
    "Perhaps the last line's operators are a little more familiar because we've seen these operators in math classes. But the first two might be a bit more confusing, so, let's dive into those first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The double equals operator (`==`) is testing whether the value of the first element is equal to that of the second element (e.g. `element_1 == element_2`).\n",
    "```python \n",
    "False == True # returns False\n",
    "False == False # returns True\n",
    "10 == 20 # returns False\n",
    "10 == 10 # returns True\n",
    "\"hi\" == \"HI\" # returns False\n",
    "\"heLLo\" == \"heLLo\" # returns True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The bang (exclamation point) equals operator (`!=`) is testing whether the value of the first element is **NOT** equal to that of the second element (e.g. `element_1 != element_2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "True != True # returns False\n",
    "True != False # returns True\n",
    "10 != 20 # returns True\n",
    "10 != 10 # returns False\n",
    "\"hi\" != \"HI\" # returns True\n",
    "\"heLLo\" != \"heLLo\" # returns False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now onto the third grouping of comparison operators. The greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), greater than or equal to (`>=`) and less than or equal (`<=`) to operators also only return `True` or `False` as the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "True > True # False\n",
    "True >= True # True\n",
    "10 <= 10 # True\n",
    "7 < 7 # False\n",
    "10 < 100 # True\n",
    "100 > 101 # False\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can even compare strings to see which is alphabetically greater or less. A string is greater if it comes after another string alphabetically (or if its ASCII value is greater). An important note is that capital letters have lower ASCII values, which means that when you make comparisions, uppercase letters will always be less than lowercase letters. For example, the ASCII alphabet would look something like: `A, B, C ... X, Y, Z ... a, b, c ... x, y, z` with `A` having the lowest ASCII value and `z` having the highest ASCII value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"APPLE\" < \"apple\" # True\n",
    "\"aaron\" > \"alexa\" # False\n",
    "\"Terrance\" > \"Teresa\" # True\n",
    "\"SAME\" == \"SAME\" # True\n",
    "```\n",
    "So, when comparing strings to other strings, it is important to be cognizant of whether the comparison should be case sensitive or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Are Comparison Operators Used?\n",
    "We've already seen some examples of this above. Essentially, we use comparison operators to *compare* two things. So, the most basic structure is two elements with an operator in between. The return value will be `True` or `False`. The best way to get comfortable with comparison operators is through practice, so, let's take a look at some examples:"

    "In this lesson, we covered a lot of material, so don't worry if it seems overwhelming right now. First we looked at objects and then built-in methods and functions in Python. They help us greatly reduce the amount of code we write while also increasing the readability and efficiency of our code.\n",

    "Next we looked at operators in Python. Operators are fundamental tools in many languages that provide a succinct way to compare multiple elements. Comparison operators return boolean values and compare the value between two elements. Logical operators compare the truthiness and falsiness of two elements and either return one of the elements or a boolean value. Identity operators compare two elements for their equality, that is whether they are the same object or not, and return a boolean value. Lastly, ternary operators are used to assign a value to a variable. They use an `if` statement and another operator to compare two values and return one of two values, which is used to assign the value of a variable."
